# React Notes

*This is my react notes website for Lab 3 in CS 52! Enjoy chatting with friends in real-time by posting notes. This was made by using React with a web-package.*

[React Notes Website](http://jordantsanz-cs52-reactnotes.surge.sh/)

This website was implemented by using the React.js front-end framework and dataflow. It's a real-time note-posting web app, with features such as deleting, editing, and creating notes, dragging notes around, rotating and setting note color, and z-index stacking.

*Here's a screenshot of two browsers; I'm editing the note still on one browser, but it's showing up in real-time on the other browser!*
