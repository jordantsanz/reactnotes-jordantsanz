# Starter Site Short Assignment

*This is the repo for my starter website that uses a webpack configuration!*

[starter site](http://jordantsanz-cs52-starter.surge.sh/)

## What Worked Well
It was really easy to add loaders to the webconfig file, which is super nice to know. 

## What Didn't
It was difficult to install yarn at first for ubuntu on windows, but after snooping around some github solutions, I figured it out.
